# RC API v2 — cross-repository implementation plan

> **Source of truth for all AI contributors.** Read this plan and `AGENTS.md` before making changes. Update status and handoff notes in the *same commit* as functional work. Do not claim a phase complete without passing its acceptance checks.

> Coordinated branches: [AmurCore](https://github.com/ARDev1161/AmurCore/tree/feat/rc-api-v2) · [rc_agent](https://github.com/ARDev1161/rc_agent/tree/feat/rc-api-v2) · [robot_orchestrator](https://github.com/ARDev1161/robot_orchestrator/tree/feat/rc-api-v2) · [ros2_rknn_llm](https://github.com/ARDev1161/ros2_rknn_llm/tree/feat/rc-api-v2). The canonical architectural decisions are in [AmurCore/PLAN.md](https://github.com/ARDev1161/AmurCore/blob/feat/rc-api-v2/PLAN.md); each repository keeps a locally actionable copy of the plan.

## Product contract (approved requirements)
- **AmurCore is an operator workstation, NOT a robot controller, LLM planner, PDDL engine or fleet scheduler.** Operator can select one of many connected robots and use joystick/camera/map; give direct Nav2 goals; submit text/audio to an orchestrator; observe autonomous tasks.
- **rc_agent is a configurable protocol gateway** between the workstation and *pre-existing* robot ROS 2 topics/services/actions or local gRPC endpoints. Never put inverse kinematics, gait, balancing, motor drivers, path planning, task scheduling, or LLM processing in rc_agent.
- Control hierarchy: physical/motor layer outside rc_agent; direct 6-DOF velocity and Cartesian end-effector pose; supervisory navigation; semi-autonomous language tasks; robot-initiated autonomous tasks. Use supported-axis declarations; do NOT add per-joint operator control.
- Assignment: explicitly selected robot -> that robot; otherwise ask external fleet allocator/OpenRMF. AmurCore never decides priority/preemption/robot allocation internally.
- **Busy teleop interception:** display active task and exactly three choices: back (unchanged), pause (resume after teleop release), cancel (do not auto-resume). Never fake pause by silently canceling Nav2; implementing backend pause/resume is a distinct acceptance gate.
- Tasks are hierarchical at any depth. Show one-line summary + expandable child states; report LLM/PlanSys2/Nav2 stages with real task/parent IDs. “accepted by planner” is NOT “execution succeeded”.
- Asynchronous bidirectional conversation; AmurCore sends text or recorded audio unchanged via rc_agent; robot can initiate prompts days later; correlate conversation and task. Robot owns history and logs; AmurCore can view/export.
- Each robot has its own 2D OccupancyGrid/pose/map; keep current map/NavDialog, waypoints/patrol and GStreamer video. Optional fused 2D maps are provided by external systems, not in rc_agent; 3D deferred.
- Robot sends a configured **capability/endpoint profile** (only abstract capabilities to AmurCore; do not disclose ROS endpoint wiring unless needed for diagnostics). No dynamic UI framework: use existing widgets, simple optional action/parameter controls.
- **Traffic:** heartbeat periodic; on connect/reconnect send coherent snapshot; thereafter publish battery/pose/health/tasks only on meaningful changes (thresholds/debounce configurable), never compare whole maps on CPU. Video is OFF for non-selected robots and GStreamer sender should stop or be gated. Inactive robots remain connected; low-rate health if necessary. Do not poll unchanged data forever.
- VPN works; no cloud broker or public-internet infrastructure in scope for v2. No assumption that all ROS actions/services can be introspected without an adapter.
- C++17, Qt5 and ROS 2; no dependency on proprietary tooling. Existing production endpoints and serialized wire fields are a compatibility boundary: additive protocol first, cutover only with tests.

## Ground-truth code pointers
- AmurCore `network/protobuf/{robot,base,navigation,map,video}.proto`, `network/server.cpp`, `amurcore.cpp`, `logic/{movements,navdialog,mapwidget}.cpp`.
- rc_agent `main.cpp`, `modules/{basecontrol,nav2,map}/`, `network/client.cpp`, `robot.cfg.in`, `params/basecontrol.yaml`.
- LLM `src/ros2_rknn_llm_node.cpp` and `src/planner_client.cpp`; planner `robot_planner/src/goal_gateway.cpp`. The planner gateway currently reports submitted/accepted/rejected; it does NOT track full execution.
- Existing AmurCore `AGENTS.md` must be preserved and extended, not discarded.
- `robot_orchestrator` is a **superproject with Git submodules**; modifications in `ros2_rknn_llm` do NOT automatically update the superproject's pinned SHA. Update the submodule pointer in a controlled later commit and do not make a main/master deployment claim without it.

## Work phases and gates (do not skip)
| Phase | State | Work (owning repo) | Acceptance / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 Baseline + coordination | DONE | feature branches; AGENTS.md + PLAN.md in all affected repos; inventory of current flow | document base refs, no default branch changes |
| P1 Additive API skeleton | IN PROGRESS | synced minimal proto across AmurCore + rc_agent; agent config -> RobotInfo; first receipt/inspection on workstation; tests | same proto byte-for-byte, legacy `Controls`/`Sensors` fields untouched, `protoc` generates; old clients continue; config defaults safe |
| P2 Robot-side endpoint bindings | TODO | configurable ROS2 cmd_vel (Twist/TwistStamped), odom/map/TF/Nav2 action names, optional local gRPC adapters with allowlists; config validation | two robot profiles, different endpoint names, no code edits; unknown types rejected; action cancellation status correct |
| P3 Multi-robot isolation | TODO | AmurCore per-connection sessions/state, selection/UI routing, per-robot maps+task+video, connection lifecycle | two concurrent agent simulators cannot cross-control or mix map/sensors; selection routes correctly; disconnect releases velocity authority |
| P4 Task + dialogue transport | TODO | correlate task/parent/stage ID, status snapshot/event, text/audio forwarding, asynchronous robot-originated chat + history/log requests | planner accept != completed; expandable stages, late prompt, disconnect/reconnect; bounded audio chunks |
| P5 Efficient streams + teleop preemption | TODO | snapshot + changed state, rate/hysteresis; independent map updates, video enable on selected robot; explicit pause/resume/cancel with backend acknowledgements | idle video network=0; no stale velocity after disconnect; no task resumes after cancel |
| P6 Cross-repo verification | TODO | integration tests (2 robots, Nav2 mock, LLM/PlanSys2 mock, GStreamer), docs, migration instructions and draft PRs | build, unit + contract tests green; observed status trace; compatibility matrix; no unreviewed merges |

## Required contract details before wiring P1/P2
- Identify `robot_id` stably from config; reject duplicate live IDs (no silent overwrite), session per authenticated stream, protocol major/minor; reconnect increments session generation.
- Velocity: linear XYZ, angular XYZ in explicit coordinate frame and **SI units** on v2 wire; existing joystick’s -255..255 legacy scale must be translated only at an explicit boundary; supported axes sent by robot. Command validity/deadman/watchdog mandatory before enabling v2 teleop. Keep local controller safety authoritative.
- Task: unique `task_id`, optional parent ID, source, typed lifecycle; accepted/queued/running/succeeded/failed/canceled/paused distinct. Reject duplicate command effects; no claim exactly-once.
- For ROS topic publish, `dispatched` means emitted, NOT physical completion. True success only from action/result/state feedback.
- Streaming: changes by semantic value with numeric threshold, event ID/sequence for replay; no expensive occupancy-grid comparison.
- Video: robot supplies ready-to-use GStreamer connection pipeline or URL; workstation chooses camera; default OFF when robot not selected.
- Security: allowlist configured endpoints; never accept arbitrary remote-supplied ROS topic, gRPC service/method, scripts, shell commands, or plugin paths; use local config authority.
- Pause/resume semantics and OpenRMF allocation are outside rc_agent; if upstream executor cannot pause, explicitly report unsupported and disable Pause button.

## Implementation rules for every contributor
1. Before editing: read **this file, `AGENTS.md`**, relevant source code and other-repo contract. Check outstanding `IN PROGRESS` items; take a small well-defined scope. Do not reimplement features already present.
2. One repository/phase per focused commit; no unrequested merge to `dev`/`master`. Keep existing ROS2 Nav2 and GStreamer functional. Never delete legacy messages, wire field numbers, or endpoints in P1.
3. Update this file's phase checklist and **Handoff** with exact changes, commit SHA or URL, tests actually executed, blockers, and next task. If change touches shared proto, sync exact definitions to BOTH repositories and prove equality.
4. Tests required: `protoc` for modified proto (when available); `cmake`/colcon on matching target OS; regression for legacy Nav2/map/video; deterministic unit tests. If dependencies absent, record `NOT RUN` with reason, never claim green.
5. Do not invent support for a ROS service/action type: register a tested adapter or fail closed. No unbounded binary audio in gRPC streams. Control must expire safely.
6. Before any change to the user-approved product contract, update an **Open decisions** entry and obtain explicit confirmation rather than silently introducing a framework.
7. GitFlow: `main/master` stable, `dev` integration where present, `feat/rc-api-v2` for this work, optional `fix/*` focused bugfixes. Conventional commits. Document owner/repo, base and deps.

## Open decisions and constraints
- Dedicated shared `rc_protocol` repository vs mirrored proto: defer; **mirror identically for P1** to avoid build-system/repo proliferation.
- Exact authentication/TLS implementation: not in P1, but do not expose public network interfaces insecurely.
- Task state replay/retention policy: define before P4; robot owns logs and canonical task state.
- ROS2 interface types and parameter mapping for nonstandard robots: P2 built-in adapters first; no dynamic script injection.
- OpenRMF integration later through external adapter, not rebuilt inside AmurCore.

## Handoff (append on each change)
- 2026-11-01: Cross-repository `feat/rc-api-v2` branches created from AmurCore:dev, rc_agent:dev, robot_orchestrator:master, ros2_rknn_llm:master. Product requirements captured above. P1 starting. No production branch changed.

### rc_agent current lane
- First: read `robot.cfg.in`, `params/basecontrol.yaml`, `main.cpp`. Some cmd_vel fields already configurable through ROS2 parameters; avoid recreating them. Make hardcoded odom/map/TF/Nav2 endpoints configurable in P2.
- P1 work: parse agent-owned capabilities config, validate stable robot id; announce via additive `Sensors.robot_info` during old stream until v2 session migration. Agent does not implement model-specific controls, IK, balance, actuators.
- Use ROS2 Humble-compatible C++17. Tests: `colcon build --packages-select rc_agent`; `colcon test --packages-select rc_agent`; use a ROS2 stub if hardware unavailable.
